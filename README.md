# üõ†Ô∏è Patch Tuesday CVE Report Tool

This tool gathers CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) information from **Microsoft**, **Adobe**, and **SAP**, checks exposure status on **Feedly**, and exports a spreadsheet of vulnerabilities for a selected month.

No technical knowledge needed ‚Äî just follow the simple steps below.

---

- Windows 10/11 (no Python required for Option 4)
- Internet connection (for fetching advisories and enrichment data)

---

## **Options to Run**

### **Option 1 ‚Äî Average**
1. Download and install the latest **Python for Windows** from:
   - [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - Tick **"Add Python to PATH"** during install.

2. Download this repository as ZIP and extract it.

3. Open Command Prompt in the extracted folder:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python PatchTuesday.py --microsoft
   ```

2. Extract to a folder, e.g. `C:\PythonPortable`.

3. From Command Prompt in your project folder:
