# 🛠️ Patch Tuesday CVE Report Tool

This tool gathers CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) information from **Microsoft**, **Adobe**, and **SAP**, checks exposure status on **Feedly**, and exports a spreadsheet of vulnerabilities for a selected month.

You can now run it directly from **GitHub Actions** (no setup required), or run it manually on your own machine if you prefer.
